# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is .NET</span>

- **.NET**:  
  .NET is a Microsoft framework used for building, deploying, and running applications.  
  It includes the following:
    - **CLR (Common Language Runtime)**: Manages code execution.
    - **FCL (Framework Class Library)**: Provides a large library of reusable functionality.

  It supports multiple programming languages and enables cross-platform development.---

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">.NET Framework vs .NET Core vs .NET</span>

- **.NET Framework**:  
  A Windows-only implementation of .NET primarily used for building Windows desktop and server-based applications.

- **.NET Core**:  
  A cross-platform, open-source framework used for modern app development, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **.NET (or .NET 5+)**:  
  The unified successor of .NET Core, combining features of both frameworks for cross-platform development.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is IL</span>

IL stands for Intermediate Language, also commonly referred to as MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) in the context
of .NET development. It is a low-level, human-readable programming language to which .NET source code (written in
languages like C#, F#, VB.NET, etc.) is compiled before it is executed.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is JIT</span>

JIT, or Just-In-Time compiler, is a component of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in the .NET framework that transforms
Intermediate Language (IL) code into machine-specific native code during program execution.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">Common Language Runtime (CLR)</span>
The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the execution engine and the core component of Microsoftâ€™s .NET framework. It acts as a runtime environment for executing .NET applications and provides essential services such as memory management, security, exception handling, and garbage collection.
