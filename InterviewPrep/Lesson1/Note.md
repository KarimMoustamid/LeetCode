# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is .NET</span>

- **.NET**:  
  .NET is a Microsoft framework used for building, deploying, and running applications.  
  It includes the following:
    - **CLR (Common Language Runtime)**: Manages code execution.
    - **FCL (Framework Class Library)**: Provides a large library of reusable functionality.

  It supports multiple programming languages and enables cross-platform development.---

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">.NET Framework vs .NET Core vs .NET</span>

- **.NET Framework**:  
  A Windows-only implementation of .NET primarily used for building Windows desktop and server-based applications.

- **.NET Core**:  
  A cross-platform, open-source framework used for modern app development, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **.NET (or .NET 5+)**:  
  The unified successor of .NET Core, combining features of both frameworks for cross-platform development.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is IL</span>

IL stands for <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">Intermediate Language</span>, also commonly referred to as
MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) in the context
of .NET development. It is a low-level, human-readable programming language to which .NET source code (written in
languages like C#, F#, VB.NET, etc.) is compiled before it is executed.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is JIT</span>

JIT, or Just-In-Time compiler, is a  <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">component of the Common Language
Runtime (CLR)</span> in the .NET framework that transforms
Intermediate Language (IL) code into machine-specific native code during program execution.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">Common Language Runtime (CLR)</span>

The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">execution engine</span> and the
core component of Microsoftâ€™s .NET framework. It acts
as a runtime environment for executing .NET applications and provides essential services such as memory management,
security, exception handling, and garbage collection.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is the Garbage Collector</span>

The Garbage Collector (GC) is an <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">automatic memory management
mechanism</span>
provided by the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in
.NET. It is responsible for managing the allocation and deallocation of memory for objects in a .NET application while
ensuring efficient memory use and preventing memory leaks.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is the CTS</span>
The <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">Common Type System</span> (CTS) is a foundational component of the .NET. It is primarily responsible for defining and enforcing how data types are declared, used, and managed in the runtime environment.
