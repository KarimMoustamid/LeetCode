# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is .NET</span>

- **.NET**:  
  .NET is a Microsoft framework used for building, deploying, and running applications.  
  It includes the following:
    - **CLR (Common Language Runtime)**: Manages code execution.
    - **FCL (Framework Class Library)**: Provides a large library of reusable functionality.

  It supports multiple programming languages and enables cross-platform development.---

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">.NET Framework vs .NET Core vs .NET</span>

- **.NET Framework**:  
  A Windows-only implementation of .NET primarily used for building Windows desktop and server-based applications.

- **.NET Core**:  
  A cross-platform, open-source framework used for modern app development, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **.NET (or .NET 5+)**:  
  The unified successor of .NET Core, combining features of both frameworks for cross-platform development.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is IL</span>

IL stands for <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">Intermediate Language</span>, also commonly referred to as
MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) in the context
of .NET development. It is a low-level, human-readable programming language to which .NET source code (written in
languages like C#, F#, VB.NET, etc.) is compiled before it is executed.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is JIT</span>

JIT, or Just-In-Time compiler, is a  <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">component of the Common Language
Runtime (CLR)</span> in the .NET framework that transforms
Intermediate Language (IL) code into machine-specific native code during program execution.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">Common Language Runtime (CLR)</span>

The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">execution engine</span> and the
core component of Microsoftâ€™s .NET framework. It acts
as a runtime environment for executing .NET applications and provides essential services such as memory management,
security, exception handling, and garbage collection.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is the Garbage Collector</span>

The Garbage Collector (GC) is an <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">automatic memory management
mechanism</span>
provided by the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in
.NET. It is responsible for managing the allocation and deallocation of memory for objects in a .NET application while
ensuring efficient memory use and preventing memory leaks.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is the CTS</span>

The <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">Common Type System</span> (CTS) is a foundational component of the
.NET. It is primarily responsible for defining and enforcing how data types are declared, used, and managed in the
runtime environment.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What is CLS</span>

The <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">Common Language Specification</span> (CLS) is a component of the
.NET. It defines a subset of rules that sets the minimum standard for features and data types that all .NET-compliant
languages need to follow in order to achieve interoperability.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What are Stack and Heap</span>

In computer programming, particularly in .NET and other modern programming environments, the Stack and Heap are two
types of memory areas used for storing and managing data during application runtime.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">What are Value Types and Reference Types</span>

In .NET (including C#), <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">Value Types and Reference Types</span> are the
two primary categories of data types.

- <span style="color:#16a34a; font-weight:bold;">Primitive and Struct Types:</span>
    - int, float, double, bool, char, etc
    - struct types and enum types.

- <span style="color:#16a34a; font-weight:bold;">Reference Types :</span>
    - A Reference Type holds a reference (or memory address) to the actual data stored in heap memory.

# <span style="color:#818cf8;">Boxing & Unboxing </span>

- <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">Boxing</span> is the process of converting a value type (e.g., int,
  float, struct) into a reference type (object).

```csharp
int num = 42;              // Value type stored in stack
object boxedNum = num;     // Boxing: Value type is wrapped into a reference type (object)
```

- <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:bold;">Unboxing</span> is the reverse process of converting a reference type (
  object) back into a value type.

```csharp
object boxedNum = 42;      // Boxing: Value type converted to reference type (object)
int num = (int)boxedNum;   // Unboxing: Object cast back to value type
```
